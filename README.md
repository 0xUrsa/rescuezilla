# Redo Backup and Recovery

Redo Backup and Recovery is an extremely easy-to-use graphical environment for system rescue, including full system backup, bare metal recovery, partition editing, undeleting files, web browsing, and more.

Redo can be booted on any PC or Mac from a USB stick, or CD, and uses the exact same reliable, battle-tested ‘partclone’ utility that Clonezilla uses. For many people, the alternative open-source tools Clonezilla and SysRescueCD, are intimidating and difficult to use, so Redo provides an easy-to-use graphical environment like the leading commercial tools, Norton Ghost and Acronis True Image.

## Features

* Simple graphical environment anyone can use
* Uses the same battle-tested ‘partclone’ utility as Clonezilla 
* Boots from Live CD or a USB drive on any PC or Mac
* Full system backup, bare metal recovery, partition editing, data protection, web browsing, and more
* Extra tools for hard drive partitioning, factory reset, undeleting files
* Can automatically locate network storage (shared folders & FTP servers)
* Web browser for downloading drivers, reading documentation
* File explorer for copying and editing files even if system won't boot
* Based on Ubuntu and partclone
